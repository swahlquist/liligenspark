=== Premium Features ===

I keep forgetting the full list of features that require a premium 
CoughDrop account, so I'm adding the list here. Basically we give users
access to most premium features during the free trial or after they
purchase an account. However, some premium features will turn off
after the duration of a long-term purchase or the end of a subscription.
These features require a "full-premium" or a currently-premium 
(not-expired) account in order to be available.

==== Premium Features ====
- Speak Mode for more than 15-minute duration
- Adding Supervisors
- Auto-Jump to Speak Mode
- Editing Boards
- Premium Voices (not available until purchase)

==== Full Premium Features ====
- Usage Reports
- Video Recording
- Modeling Ideas
- Creating and Tracking Goals
- Badge Tracking and Notifications
- Quick Assessments
- Reviewing Logs/Team Messaging
- Messaging Supervisors and Contacts (supervisors may message premium communicators w/o premium account)
- Third-Party Integrations (supervisors can preview integrations w/o premium account)
