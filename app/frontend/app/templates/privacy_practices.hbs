    <h2>Respecting User Privacy</h2>
    <p>Updated: December 11, 2020</p>
    
    <p>CoughDrop is a powerful, flexible communication app and system that enables communicators 
    and the teams around them to develop a personalized language learning strategy and
    to communicate effectively. Because CoughDrop is used in medical and educational settings for
    different ages of user, we are sensitive to state and federal regulations like FERPA,
    HIPAA, COPPA, etc. and work hard to track policies related to those regulations.
    Compliance with privacy and security regulations requires collaboration
    between CoughDrop and the institutions that use our software. As such, we have 
    compiled this set of assertions and best practices to prevent exposing personal information
    to anyone who shouldn't have access to it.</p>
    
    <p>CoughDrop uses the cloud to back up, synchronize, and report on
    a communicator's vocabulary and activities. We do this to provide convenience for
    users (backup and multi-device support), insights on communicator progress, 
    collaboration across support teams, accountability for organizations, and general
    trends across the site. Because of the potentially sensitive nature
    of the information related to an individual's communication, we take user privacy very
    seriously. Below are some of our protection strategies, and best practices that you can
    follow to ensure the privacy and rights of the communicator are respected. The 
    information is provided to help organizations in their decision-making and
    training processes, and may change over time.</p>
    
    <h4>Personal Information</h4>
    <p>By default CoughDrop tries to collect as little personal information as possible about
    our users. At registration we ask for a username and email address, and we record the initial
    IP address for location tracking purposes. Any additional information provided by the 
    user is optional and opt-in. Some features of CoughDrop, if enabled, will result in 
    additional levels of tracking and information storage. For example, logging records
    additional data as the user uses the system, and the personalization of boards results
    in the storage of additional images and data fields based on the user-entered information.
    <b>We encourage therapy and educational teams to discuss together what information
    is appropriate to be added for an individual user</b>.</p>
    
    <h4>General Access</h4>
    <p>By default CoughDrop doesn't collect personal or academic information about our users.
    Access to CoughDrop is login-based, and every user must have a user name, email address,
    and password. However, the email address can be reused or even be invalid if needed.
    <b>We encourage therapy and educational teams who create logins on behalf of their
    users to use anonymized user names</b>, and many programs already have anonymized identifiers
    in place for the users they work with.</p>
    
    <h4>User-Generated Data</h4>
    <p>The CoughDrop application communicates with remote servers to download and update
    user-generated information such as board content, logs, etc. This communication is always
    done over a secure, encrypted (SSL) channel. In addition, user-generated 
    content such as buttons, email address, profile information
    and log data is all treated as potentially private and personal information,
    and is encrypted before being stored to prevent unauthorized access. Most pages
    within CoughDrop can potentially contain private information, so rather than
    use confidential information warnings on every page, <b>we encourage
    organizations to treat all CoughDrop access as potentially private and confidential</b>.</p> 
    <p>Within
    the system users can specify that their account is "public", in which case basic 
    user-entered information like summary, public boards, etc. will be available to
    any CoughDrop users, but this is an opt-in behavior. <b>We discourage communicator
    accounts from being set to public.</b> The 
    user name tied to each account is not encrypted, and without authorization another
    CoughDrop user can check on the existence of a specific user name, but will not be 
    able to retrieve any additional non-public information about that user name. This is another 
    reason why we encourage teams to use anonymized user names when creating accounts
    for their communicators.</p>
    
    <p>Administrative access within CoughDrop is limited to only those who need direct
    access to fulfil their work responsibilities.
    CoughDrop employees and subcontractors with potential access to personal data are 
    trained on user privacy best practices
    and are instructed to only access information needed for supporting communicators and
    teams. Within the app, access to user information is based on strict access controls,
    and any access to a communicator's information must be authorized by the communicator
    account. The only exception to this is if an organization creates communicator accounts
    and assigns them to communicators, in which case <b>we encourage organizations to make
    sure communicators are aware of and comfortable with the organization's access to their 
    information</b> before proceeding.</p>
    
    <p>Because communication is personal and individualized, many communicators add buttons
    representing personal information, such as family members, medical details, addresses, 
    etc. The system does not prevent this type of information from being added, but it is
    not required. Such user-generated data will be encrypted, but is still available once
    logged in. <b>Support teams should talk with communicators before adding potentially
    sensitive information to their boards, and should remember that this information could 
    technically be discovered
    by anyone with physical access to the communicator's device.</b></p>
    
    <p>It is important to note that user-uploaded files including images (including photographs),
    audio records and videos uploaded to the CoughDrop system
    are encrypted in transit via SSL, but are not encrypted at rest (although they are
    protected from unintentional access using long randomly-generated identifiers), and <b>we 
    suggest only uploading anonymized images and
    videos that do not disclose private information</b>.</p>
    
    <h4>Logs, Reports and Tracking</h4>
    <p>In addition, communicators can add "supervisors" to their account. Supervisors are 
    additional logins that are used to a different person, possibly a therapist, parent, teacher,
    grandparent, aide, etc. Supervisors can be added as read-only or with permission to edit
    a communicator's boards. All supervisors have access to a communicator's full vocabulary
    set and any logs that have been recorded. As such, <b>we encourage support teams to 
    check with communicators before adding anyone as a supervisor to their account on their
    behalf</b>.</p>
    
    <p>CoughDrop has a built-in logging and reporting mechanism that can provide valuable insights
    and summaries of communication usage and progress over time. Data can be a powerful
    tool as support teams try to assess a communicator's progress across multiple 
    environments and times of day. However, logging every button
    a communicator selects is a <b>highly invasive</b> action, and <b>support teams should
    get explicit permission from a communicator before enabling logging on their behalf.</b>
    There are two levels of logging in CoughDrop, general logging which records every action
    in a user's communication session, and an additional level which also tracks GPS
    locations to be used for filtering data based on physical location. Both levels are 
    opt-in, and CoughDrop includes a user-controlled mechanism which can permanently 
    delete all previous logs generated in the system (this purge can take up to 24 hours).
    You can see what information is recorded via logging in our
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XA8M0aEghcRMQoRnK_tbnk1A7hWoekMSW5ScR2LKusw/edit?usp=sharing" target='_blank'>data and services tracker</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>CoughDrop incorporates anonymized data from all user-generated logs to share
    usage trends such as most common words, core vs. fringe breakdown, etc. These public
    trends are always strictly anonymized and not gathered without enough different user
    sources to ensure individual user information is protected. When users enable logging
    they can opt-in to allowing their usage log information to be anonymized and shared
    with third-party research groups. Personally-identifiable information, including
    email addresses, personalized phrases or location information, will not be shared with outside 
    research parties without explicit user consent.</p>
    
    <h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
    <p>Some components of CoughDrop take advantage of third-party services to improve 
    the user experience. CoughDrop reports send anonymized data to the
    Google Charts service to generate visualizations of usage over time. CoughDrop
    uses Google Analytics to track user trends and to help evaluate the effectiveness of
    new features. These third-party services are opt-in, and the  actions that enable 
    these services are clearly delineated within the system.</p>
    
    <p>Additionally, CoughDrop "launches" players for third party content including
    YouTube, Tarheel Reader and OpenAAC. By default these launches do not send any 
    CoughDrop-stored information unless clearly specified when setting up the tool 
    for a user. These third-party services may include
    their own tracking mechanisms, and can be included as button launches on user
    boards. CoughDrop also allows for "launches" from arbitrary web sites based on
    user-entered URLs. 
    Control over whether to allow third-party launches is available
    in a user's preferences, and <b>we encourage teams concerned about external
    tracking to disable third-party launches for their users</b>.</p>
    
    <p>We use the server-based troubleshooting and logging services 
    listed in our 
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XA8M0aEghcRMQoRnK_tbnk1A7hWoekMSW5ScR2LKusw/edit?usp=sharing" target='_blank'>data and services tracker</a>
    to aid in application 
    troubleshooting and information security, which send limited user metadata such as IP Address and
    User Agent, but this data is deleted after 7-14 days. Organization-created
    communicator accounts have error tracking disabled by default for everything 
    other than IP address (which we keep to use to combat fraud and maintain 
    information security), 
    so <b>we encourage organizations
    to create user accounts through the organization interface, or to manually
    disable error tracking in a user's preferences if there are concerns
    about user metadata being stored outside the system</b>.</p>
    
    <p>In addition, CoughDrop collects contact information when users sign up or purchase
    the app. This information is used for support and marketing purposes and is stored
    in third-party systems that CoughDrop uses for communication and support. The
    information shared includes name, email address and IP address. 
    However, organization-created
    communicator accounts are not shared with third-party communication services, so 
    <b>we encourage organizations to create user accounts through the organization 
    interface to prevent email addresses from being shared</b> with these third-party
    services. If your users are not created this way, you can disable this setting
    in your user preferences
    and we will remove your information from our marketing tools.</p>
    
    <p>CoughDrop can optionally send out notifications to communicators and supervisors.
    These notifications include things like weekly usage summaries, notifications of badges
    earned, or messages sent by the communicator from within the app. It is possible that
    information sent in these notifications will contain user-generated information such
    as buttons pressed or goals set. These notifications
    can be sent via email, SMS, or as alerts on the user's dashboard. Email is the default
    notification policy. <b>If private information has been added to boards or used in
    creating goals or other such systems, we encourage communicators and supervisors to 
    set their notification preferences to remain within the app so as to prevent 
    the unwanted exposure of user information.</b></p>
    
    <h4>Session Timeouts</h4>
    <p>CoughDrop is accessible from mobile and Windows apps, or from any modern web 
    browser. Access requires entering the user's user name and password before
    being granted access to the user's interface, which will include their own content
    and the content of any users who have added them as a supervisor. 
    When accessing from a web browser, the user session will expire by default
    after 24 hours of inactivity unless otherwise specified by the user. 
    The user can opt-in to a longer timeout which will
    expire after multiple days of inactivity. <b>To help protect user information, we
    encourage browser-based logins to use the shorter timeout, and to manually log
    out after each session.</b> App-based logins use the longer timeout by default, so
    <b>we encourage app-based logins to set up a device-level PIN or password to prevent
    unauthorized access through the physical device.</b>
    </p>

    <h4>Backing Up Data</h4>
    <p>CoughDrop databases are backed up regularly with the same encryption as the
    live database. File uploads by users are backed up to multiple facilities by
    our data storage partners. In the event of a catastrophic event, or breach or
    misconfiguration resulting in
    in data loss, CoughDrop does 
    not guarantee that user information and content will be retrievable, but CoughDrop
    will work in a commercially reasonable manner to restore any and all lost information.
    Any total loss of informatin will be communicated to the affected parties
    within 72 hours. For more information please see our 
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-lOUufZJy70jbF5Y0fuG7nHMONjLp2a7r2_oUyiknE/edit?usp=sharing">incident response documentation</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Removing Old Data</h4>
    <p>CoughDrop logs and board provide ongoing value, so for active users this information
    is not deleted. Users may choose to delete their usage logs in their entirety at any time,
    or delete their full account including boards and logs, from within their profile. When
    an account deletion is requested we delay the deletion for up to 18 days to allow for
    cancellations or mistakes. Some users take advantage of CoughDrop's features only seasonally,
    so we wait a full year of inactivity before initiating the process of automatically
    deleting a user's profile, but users can always request the account to be removed
    sooner if they would like. Accounts created by organizations are not deleted
    until requested by the organization, or after the termination of the contract.
    When an account is deleted, boards and logs are removed
    as well, but historical aggregate data generated using those data sources will not
    be updated, as this aggregate data does not expose user-specific information.</p>
    <p>An organization may, as part of their transition to another service, wish to 
    migrate their data out of CoughDrop. On an as-needed basis we will work with these
    organizations to create a standard export of all organization and user data that
    is recorded within CoughDrop. Such an export will contain only information directly
    tied to the organization, and only for users created by the organization. Users
    who sign up for their own accounts are are later added to the organization will need
    to grant permission on a one-by-one basis before their information can be included
    in an organization export.</p>

    <h4>Requests for User Information</h4>
    <p>On request, we can provide information about accounts for support or general 
    usage purpose. By default we will only provide this information to someone tied
    directly to the specified account (i.e. with a matching email address), or is
    authorized within CoughDrop to supervise the account. Organizations can define
    users as administrators within the CoughDrop app, and will then also be allowed
    to request information for users within their organization. If a parent or other
    user who is not authorized within CoughDrop requests information, we will verify
    their authorization with the organization tied to the user's account. If the 
    user is not tied to an organization, we will confirm with the user account directly
    before sharing information about the user. We do not share non-anonymizeed data
    with third parties other than what is recorded in the
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XA8M0aEghcRMQoRnK_tbnk1A7hWoekMSW5ScR2LKusw/edit?usp=sharing" target='_blank'>data and services tracker</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Security Breaches</h4>
    <p>We have many security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access 
    to user information, including training our employees on privacy and encrypting and
    obfuscating data sources. However, as we have seen in recent years even strict
    security measures are at times compromised. In the event that personal user information 
    is exposed to unapproved parties, or 
    CoughDrop becomes aware of unauthorized access to our internal system resources, we will notify
    affected users via email within 72 hours, unless organization partners agree upon
    a different notification process. If comprehensive information is not available
    at the time of the report we will include a schedule of updates, not less often than
    one update per week, until the issue has been resolved or concluded.

    </p>
    
    <p>At CoughDrop we work hard to ensure communicators are respected and given the privacy
    that everyone deserves. If you have questions about these policies please don't hesitate
    to reach out to us.</p>
